            <div class="content-box">
                <p>The IT Museum at Christ University, in collaboration with DataArt, is a groundbreaking multimedia project dedicated to exploring and preserving the fascinating relationship between traditional Indian art forms and modern computer science. Our primary focus is on Kolam Art - an ancient South Indian geometric tradition that has profound connections to pattern recognition, computer vision, automata theory, and artificial intelligence.</p>
                
                <p>This unique museum showcases how traditional Kolam patterns, drawn with mathematical precision and involving symmetry, recursion, and fractals, serve as valuable case studies for computational applications. Inspired by pioneering researchers like Dr. Gift Siromoney, we document Kolam's cultural heritage and mathematical foundations while integrating cutting-edge computational techniques.</p>

                <p>Located at the prestigious Yeshwanthpur campus in Bangalore - India's Silicon Valley - our museum serves as a bridge between India's rich cultural heritage and cutting-edge technological innovation, inspiring the next generation of technologists to find inspiration in tradition.</p>

        <!-- What is Kolam - Quick Introduction -->
        <section class="section">
            <h2>What is Kolam Art?</h2>
            <div class="content-box">
                <p>Kolam is an ancient Indian folk art extensively practiced in Southern India, particularly in Tamil Nadu. These intricate geometric patterns are drawn at the thresholds of homes using rice flour or colored powders, representing prosperity, positivity, and welcome.</p>

                <div class="highlight-box">
                    <p><strong>The Word "Kolam"</strong> in Tamil means "form and beauty" - a symbol of auspiciousness and divinity that has been practiced for thousands of years.</p>
                </div>

                <h4>Why Kolam Matters to Computer Science</h4>
                <p>Kolam patterns are not just beautiful - they embody complex mathematical principles:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Pattern Recognition:</strong> The structured, repetitive nature makes them ideal for AI training</li>
                    <li><strong>Graph Theory:</strong> Many Kolams are Eulerian graphs drawn in a single continuous line</li>
                    <li><strong>Automata Theory:</strong> Kolam follows rule-based generation similar to formal grammars</li>
                    <li><strong>Fractals & Recursion:</strong> Nested patterns exhibit self-similarity across scales</li>
                    <li><strong>Computational Geometry:</strong> Grid-based designs perfect for algorithmic modeling</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Introduction to Kolam</h3>
                <p>Kolam is an ancient Indian folk art extensively used to beautifully adorn the thresholds and open courtyards in front of houses, particularly in Southern India. This ornamentation and visually appealing art has been an essential and valuable part of Indian society for thousands of years, representing concepts of prosperity, positivity, and the welcome reception of guests and gods alike into the sacred space of the home.</p>
                
                <p>The word "Kolam" in the Tamil language means form and beauty. A symbol of auspiciousness and divinity, it is made with rice flour, finely ground rice powder (called kola-podi in Tamil), or at times vegetable and mineral-based colored powders on carefully swept and water-sprinkled cleaned grounds.</p>

                <h4>The Art of Creating Kolam</h4>
                <p>Women take this powder in a pinching-like manner at the tips of their fingers and start gently drawing the pattern by letting the powder fall in a controlled way to obtain the desired design. The process involves concentration, memory, and a series of disciplined hand and body movements. The designs can vary from simple to complex depending on the event, occasion, or season.</p>

                <p>For special occasions, to make the design last longer, the rice flour is made wet by adding water. These semi-permanent patterns are called Makolam, created almost as if the fingers were acting as an ink pen.</p>

                <h3>Regional Variations Across India</h3>

                <p>Kolam drawing is an ancient and widespread practice in South India, practiced by women of all ages. Young girls start their initiation into the art at a very young age, learning by observing their mothers and grandmothers.</p>

                <p>This ancient tradition is not just a way of adorning houses; it is also a meditative and social practice that challenges creativity, patience, and a sense of cultural continuity over generations. Colorful kolam competitions are held during festive celebrations, bringing neighbors and relatives together to exchange ideas and techniques.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="content-box">
                <h3>Modern Adaptations and Innovations</h3>
                <p>As times have progressed, the art of drawing kolams has undergone remarkable change, including the use of modern materials like contemporary colored powders, chalk, and even digital art. Some artists now employ innovative methods to draw kolams on large canvases for showcasing.</p>

                <p>The digital revolution has provided designers with opportunities to experiment with intricate mathematical patterns and design computer-generated kolams. In urban settings, individuals use stencils to quickly draw intricate patterns, keeping the tradition alive despite time constraints.</p>

                <div class="highlight-box">
                    <p><strong>Research Connection:</strong> Researchers and mathematicians have been enthusiastic about kolam patterns due to their complex geometric nature.

                    <p>Kolam patterns, drawn on a grid of dots (pulli), feature intricate designs that can be single-threaded (kambi) or multi-threaded, offering great opportunities for computational modeling.</p>

                    <h4>L-Systems (Lindenmayer Systems)</h4>
                    <p>L-systems use a set of rules to iteratively generate complex patterns, ideal for mimicking the step-by-step drawing process of Kolam:</p>
